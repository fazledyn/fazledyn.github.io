Hi, I am Ataf Fazledin Ahamed. I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©.

I work as a Software Security Engineer at OpenRefactory. I completed my graduation from the Department of CSE of [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/).

During my undergraduate life, I participated in different competitions- CTF, hackathons, etc. My team once became third in Bangladesh National Cyber Drill. I worked as a problem-setter and hosted different CTF competitions. 

Apart from that, I enjoy contributing to open source projects. **I have 60+ merged pull requests with contribution in notable projects such as- dapr, kubernetes, web3.py, timesketch, django-helpdesk**. You can find a list of them [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BhXlbzaMkDmWduV4PjRDu-BWO8mMlE3szC8ef0PWiZM/) I'm working with OpenSSF and Apache Airflow as a part of my work. Learn more about it [here.](http://localhost:1313/projects/#the-clean-beach-project).

My key interests lies in **systems, network, and software/application security**. I intend to pursue my higher studies in these domains. I would say my interest in these fields during my undergraduate life incited me to participate in the CTFs in the first place.

During my school and work life, I have had the priviledge to  lead others. I believe I am hard working as well as an adaptive learner.
