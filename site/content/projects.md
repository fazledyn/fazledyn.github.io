# Work
## Finding & Fixing Bugs in Open Source Softwares
[Blog Post by OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/12/05/finding-and-fixing-bugs-in-open-source-software-at-scale-with-a-grant-from-alpha-omega/) | [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K8dc6SrSEoqqh46cFisZM1tiN4CigaXsqkCKfCM8UTs/edit?gid=1270834270#gid=1270834270)

As **OpenRefactory**'s one of the software security engineers, I worked alongside **OpenSSF**'s project [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/) to find and fix vulnerabilities in popular open source projects in GitHub. Based on our findings, we created patches and fixed the bugs in the projects by collaborating with the project maintainers.

## OpenRefactory Triage Portal
[Website](https://pypi.openrefactory.com)

This was my first project after joining OpenRefactory as a software security engineer. This portal was developed to assist us in our work of finding and fixing bugs in open source softwares. We primarily used (and still do) this portal to triage bugs and submit PR, PVR, Issue directly.

## The Clean Beach Project
Ongoing Project

It's an ongoing project at OpenRefactory where I'm working as the project lead. This project is mainly focused on supply chain security of popular open source projects. As a part of this project, we're collaborating with the **Apache Foundation** (for [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) and **OpenSSF** for securing their supply chain dependencies.

It's a fork of CTFd - a popular CTF hosting platform. I developed it during organizing a CTF at my university. It contains a few additional features such as-
- SSL/TLS Certificate Support for Databases
- Updated Docker Compose file capable of cloud provider based setup
- Updated scripts capable of debugging and testing database and s3 connections

# Academic
## Gender Classification from Audio Clips 
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/fazledyn/gender-classification-from-audio-clips) | [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14BWOq6YSmO3GqZHEvCou43Z5A4dlOmKq4pjqUqgZALU/)


In this project, we built a machine learning model capable of identifying the sex of a person from their voice recording. Mel Spectrogram and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) was used as the intermediary data format for the model. Two large datasets (Common Voice by Mozilla and Bengali Voice Speech) was used to train the models.

This project was a part of the CSE 472 Machine Learning sessional course. Both my friend and I contributed to this project.

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/orgs/eventfly/repositories) | [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F7u2Gd58l1ELqF-vthFWd2ZWTiked1lhL3o7uOlDPf0/edit?usp=sharing)

EventFly is an online event management tool where users can host both online and offline events. It offers a wide range of services such as ticketing, billing, event schedule and a real-time event feed. This project was developed as a part of CSE 408: Software Engineering sessional course.

I, along with five of my peers contributed to this project as a group. I worked as the project manager and worked mostly on the frontend part of this project.
